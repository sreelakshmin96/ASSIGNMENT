<h1><b>COMPUTER</b></h1>
<h4><a href="#c1">GO TO TOP</a></h4>
<p><h4>A computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operation. Since a sequence of operations can be readily changed, the computer can solve more than one kind of problem</h4></p>
<h4 id="c2"><b>cpu</b></h4>
<p><h4>A central processing unit(CPU), also reffered to as a central processor unit, is the hardware within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetical, logical, and input.output operations of the system. The term has been in use in the computer industry at least since the early 1960s. The form, design, and implementation of CPUs have changed over the course of their history, but their fundamental operation remains much the same.</h4></p>
<h4 id="c3"><b>ALU</b></h4>
<p><h4>In computing, an arithmetic and logic unit (ALU) is a digital circuit that performs integer arithmetic and logical operations. The ALU is a fundamental building block of the central processing unit of a computer, and even the simplest microprocessors contain one for purpose such as maintaining timers. The processors found inside modern CPUs and graphics processing units(GPUs) accommodate very powerful and very complex ALUs; a single component may contain a number of ALUs.</h4></p>
<h1><b>PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES</b></h1>
<p><h4> A programming language is a formal language desired to communicate instructions to a machine .Particularly a computer programming language can be used to create program that control the behavior of a machine and/or to express algorithm precisely.</h4></p>
<h3 id="c4"><b>c</b></h3>
<p><h4>C is one of the most widely used programming languages of all time,and C compilers are available for the majority of available computer architectures and operating systems </h4></p>
<h3 id="c5"><b>c<sup>++</sup></b></h3>
<p><h4>C++ (pronounced cee plus plus)is a programming language that is  general-purpose,statically typed,free-form, multi-paradigm and compiled .It is regarded as an intermediate-level language,as it comprises both high-level and low-level language features</h4></p>
